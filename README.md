# File-Organizer
Organizes all the files present in systematic way

This is a "File Mapping project".
It arranges all the files present into different types. eg :
docs:pdf,xls,docx
media:mp4,mkv

The files present in another folder is also structured here.
All the file's path is shown systematically.
I named my command prompt command "Munchy" in the bin section.
In the video,I didn't use the organize command in terminal  because then , the output would have taken a longer time.

It's good for lazy people like me whose system is full of disorganised files.ðŸ™‚
